Great, let's outline the development plan based on your requirements:

## Development Plan

### 1. Plugin Setup and Configuration
- **Microsoft Teams SDK:** Set up the development environment using Microsoft Teams SDK.
- **App Registration:** Register the application in Azure AD to get the necessary permissions for accessing meeting transcripts.

### 2. Transcript Retrieval
- **Microsoft Graph API:** Use Microsoft Graph API to fetch the meeting transcript once the meeting ends.

### 3. Integration with GPT-4 using Langchain
- **Langchain Framework:** Set up Langchain to interact with the GPT-4 model.
- **API Integration:** Develop the backend logic to send the transcript to GPT-4 and receive the processed output.

### 4. Processing Output
- **Minutes of Meetings (MoM):** Extract the summary of the meeting.
- **Action Items:** Identify and extract action items with the names mentioned.

### 5. Output Formatting
- **Bulleted List:** Format the output as a bulleted list for both MoM and action items.

### 6. Deployment
- **Internal Deployment:** Deploy the plugin within your organization using the Teams App Store.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup Microsoft Teams Plugin

1. **Create the Teams App Manifest:**
    - Define your app's metadata in the `manifest.json` file.

2. **Development Environment:**
    - Use tools like Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code to create and manage your Teams app.

### Step 2: Fetch Meeting Transcripts

1. **Register the App in Azure AD:**
    - Obtain the necessary permissions to access the Microsoft Graph API.

2. **Graph API Integration:**
    - Use the Graph API to fetch the transcript of a completed meeting.
    - Example API endpoint: `GET /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}/messages/{message-id}/transcript`

### Step 3: Integrate with GPT-4 using Langchain

1. **Setup Langchain:**
    - Install and configure the Langchain framework in your backend service.

2. **API Call to GPT-4:**
    - Send the transcript to GPT-4 using Langchain and handle the response.
    - Example code snippet (Python):

    ```python
    from langchain import GPT4, prompt

    def get_meeting_summary(transcript):
        gpt4 = GPT4(api_key="your-api-key")
        prompt_text = f"Summarize the following meeting transcript and list action items:\n\n{transcript}"
        response = gpt4.generate(prompt=prompt_text)
        return response['summary'], response['action_items']
    ```

### Step 4: Process and Format Output

1. **Extract Summary and Action Items:**
    - Parse the response from GPT-4 to separate the summary and action items.
    - Format them as bulleted lists.

### Step 5: Deploy the Plugin

1. **Internal Deployment:**
    - Package your app and upload it to your organization's Teams App Store.
    - Ensure it's accessible and test its functionality within the internal environment.

## Next Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup:**
    - Set up the Teams SDK and configure your development environment.

2. **Azure AD Registration:**
    - Register your app in Azure AD and obtain the necessary API permissions.

3. **Develop and Test:**
    - Implement the transcript retrieval and GPT-4 integration.
    - Test the complete workflow from transcript generation to output formatting.

4. **Deploy Internally:**
    - Package and deploy the plugin within your organization.
